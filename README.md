# Anadiplosis finder

An anadiplosis is is the repetition of the last word of a preceding clause; for the purpose of this script, it is the repetition of the last word of the first line as the first word of the second line. 
"Anadiplosis finder" tries to find the longest possible _chains_ of anadiploses over a text file. 
The complexity of the resulting chain can be too high for the program to handle it; I still need to reduce the O complexity.
